# About

## Introduction

The E-Fidget is a new kind of fidget spinner. It uses haptic feedback in the form of 8
vibration motors to simulate the feeling of spinning while not moving at all. This provides
several benefits, including being able to be "spun" from inside of a pocket to reduce distraction,
and much lower noise levels.

## Hardware overview

The E-Fidget is based around the RP2040 microcontroller, the same one found inside the popular
Raspberry Pi Pico! It has 16 MBits of on-board flash storage, and 8 vibration motors with
corresponding MOSFET drivers.

## Software overview

The recommended software for the E-Fidget is CircuitPython, the easy-to-use Python
port for microcontrollers. While you're free to try other languages, I won't be able
to support you with them as readily! (I'll still try, of course)
